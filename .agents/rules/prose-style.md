description: When writing prose (documentation, journey files, summaries)

- **Prefer verbs over nominalizations.** Write "we aligned" not "the alignment was performed". Use strong, specific verbs.
- **Use active voice by default.** Reserve passive voice for when the actor is unknown or unimportant.
- **Cut filler and hedge words.** Remove "basically", "actually", "it should be noted that", "in order to". Say what you mean directly.
- **Lead with the point.** State the conclusion or key fact first, then provide supporting detail. Do not bury the point at the end of a paragraph.
- **Keep sentences short.** Break long compound sentences into two. Aim for one idea per sentence.
- **Eliminate redundancy.** Do not repeat the same fact in different words across adjacent sentences.
- **Be specific.** Replace vague phrases ("the relevant configuration") with concrete names (`columns = 1024`). Use exact function names, file paths, and values.
- **Verify every claim against the code.** If you reference a type, function, or mechanism, confirm it matches the current codebase. Do not guess.
- **Do NOT** add an extra new line after a section header in Markdown
